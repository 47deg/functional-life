<p>Having closures around sure helped to fix a big hole in Objective-C&#39;s collection types: the lack of 3 basic higher-order sequence functions that are supported by many other languages: Map, Filter and Reduce. These address common operations on collections and allows us to do some powerful stuff with few lines of code. Let&#39;s take a closer look to each one of them</p>
<p><strong>Map</strong>: allows us to create take every item in a collection, apply a function to it, and return a new collection with the transformed values. We have done it so many times in the past it&#39;s almost automatic to start writing a for-each loop... Not anymore!</p>
