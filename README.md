#functionallife

**Functional Life** is a small iOS project to showcase some of the functionalities that I've talked about in [this article](http://www.47deg.com) for the 47 Degrees blog. It's a really basic implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** algorithm, done with **SpriteKit**. The algorithm is implemented in the *FLGameAlgorithm* class, which you'll see is really succinct. I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement here, and maybe I put some time on it in the future, but for now on you can play with it as it is.

#Compatibility
**Functional Life** runs under iOS 8, and was developed with Swift 1.0.

#Swift and Scala similarities
As mentioned earlier, this project is the result of applying some of the functional patterns I've been learning while writing an article about the [similarities between Swift and Scala](http://www.47deg.com). I've also included the article in interactive Playground format in this repo for you to read and play with if interested. You can find it in the **Swift-Scala Playground** directory.
